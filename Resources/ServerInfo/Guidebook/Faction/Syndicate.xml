   Much like NanoTrasen, this faction has existed since Day 1.
   As mysterious as it is brutal, CyberSun has a lineage of many, many wars.
   They're highly aggressive, fighting just about anyone who gets in their way, and largely that mostly exists in NanoTrasen.
   That being said, with war comes power. Many argue NanoTrasen is weaker than CyberSun, and whether it's true or not, what CyberSun has in weaponry, it lacks in numbers, often times being    considered "The bad guys" by many because of their lethal tactics of destroying stations through whatever means, whether it's through corrupting minds with radio signals to make revolutions,    gather intel through a spy, or sending in Operatives to just destroy these stations.
   While many may not like CyberSun, many are willing to work for them, though typically not excluding previous force or brainwashing first.
