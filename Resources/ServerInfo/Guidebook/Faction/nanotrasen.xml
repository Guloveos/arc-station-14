   Having started from the Earth-times, NanoTrasen was the first of several companies to have made progress to the stars.
   This faction is largely collectivist, and accepts anyone willing to work alongside eachother. That being said, there is one main enemy.
   CyberSun. CyberSun and NanoTrasen have disliked eachother since day 1. They both fight and attempt to conquer the other, and have been at a massive war since day 1 of them both having reached    the stars, both competing over the deep galactic space that they both so desperately cling onto.
   NanoTrasen has many enemies, but they're usually relatively friendly. While the truth behind them is mysterious, where even workers don't know how or when they got there, it truly does have an    amazing history, and will last throughout time as the largest space-company of all time.
