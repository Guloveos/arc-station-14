  From locks to private military contracting, Urban Solutions really offers it all. In operation for over 500 years, they have gradually clawed their way up the corporate chain through mergers   and underhanded dealings. Now operating in space, their relations to most groups are flat neutral, with the megacorp caring more about their shareholders than loyalties to their clients.

  This of course can put them at odds with Nanotrasen as their "money first, morals later" attitude leads to them often coming into conflict with the group. On the flipside, this also leads them   into conflict with the Syndicate, leaving them to be untrusted by either group and mostly contracted as a desperate measure or by some outside party.

  While most people know the group for its excellent home and ship security services. Their workwear is unmatched, with their state-of-the-art envirosuit being a blend of high quality work wear   and being strong enough to be worn under smaller EVA systems, allowing it to serve the role of EVA and on-the-ground work.
